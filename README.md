# Reasy

Reasy is an issues management implemented in C++ for a semester 
project for my OOP class at the University of Bucharest. 

## Features

### 🏢 Workspaces

Separate your issues per workspace, for easier following of them

### 🤝 Collaboration

Multiple users have access to a workspace and can edit it as they wish

### 🧵 Threads

Each issue can have a thread of comments, sub-issues, for better collaboration

### 💽 GRPC Server (planned)

### 💉 Compile-time dependency injection

Dependency injection is an application level pattern that enables the usage of
dependency inversion principle. However, usually dependencies are resolved at 
runtime, even if they are known at compile-time. Through the usage of concepts,
templates and a dependency inversion container, I plan to implement this behaviour.
